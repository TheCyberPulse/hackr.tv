# Welcome to The.CyberPul.se!

This repository is the content and generation code for https://hackr.tv, our
primary presence in CyberSpace.

It is a bare-bones static site generator written in Ruby and invoked via Rake.
It also creates redirects which are executed using PHP (see
`layout/redirect.php`).

Some day, there may be more dynamic application code (beyond the simple
redirects), but for now, a (mostly) static site more than suffices.
